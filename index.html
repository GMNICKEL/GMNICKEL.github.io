			<p>Welcome to my first webpage! My name is Grayson Nickel and I am currently a full time student at UNCC. My major is Computer science and my concentration is IT. I am very passionate about computers and am always willing to learn more about them. Currently I am only using this site for school but I plan for it to be more than that. This page will serve as a hub where you can access my classwork but also learn more about me and any other projects I work on. There are some links below that may interest you, please have a look.</p>
