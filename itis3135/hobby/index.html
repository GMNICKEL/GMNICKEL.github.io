            <p>My name is Grayson Nickel and I am an RC hobbyist. This page is dedicated to my passion for the RC hobby,
                specifically my favourite part, which is RC cars! I am currently a college student at UNCC studying
                Computer Science and I plan to encororate this knowledge not just to my future job but also my hobby.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <h3>Here is a list of some of my RC cars</h3>
                <li>Traxxas Rustler 4x4</li>
                <li>Arrma Typhon 6s</li>
                <li>Arrma Fireteam 6s</li>
                <li>Traxxas Rustler 2wd</li>
                <li>Tamiya TT02</li>
                <li>Arrma Outcast 8s</li>
                <li>3D printed Open RC F1</li>
                <li>Losi Micro B</li>
                <li>Traxxas TRX4</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My favorite car out of all the different RC cars I own is the Arrma Outcast 8s. It's a 1/5 scale monster
                powered by two 4s lipo batteries running in sync for a total od 8s. The car wieghs around 30 pounds and
                has a top speed somewhere around 50mph. The image at the top is of that car.</p>

            <p>The RC car hobby is all about remote controlled RC cars. There are so many different kinds and sizes of
                RC cars. In this hobby, not only do you drive the cars, you bash em, break em, fix em, and upgrade em.
                Of course there are people who are a little more gentle with their cars and prefer to race on tracks and
                the like but there arent any tracks nearby. So me and my RC buddies tend to find some open land, slap
                some jumps together and send our cars to the moon!</p>
            <p>Of course, this hobby is only so much fun by yourself. If you're considering getting into the hobby, make
                sure to bully your friends into getting one too so you have some driving buddies!</p>

            <p>The best time to pick up your remote and start driving has got to be the Summer break. It's the perfect
                weather, usually nice and dry, and there's no school. This is when me and my friends drive our cars the
                most and if you get into the hobby, you should take advantage of the Summer while it lasts too.</p>
            <ul>
                <h3>Positives of Summer</h3>
                <li>Nice warm weather</li>
                <li>Not too much rain and mud</li>
                <li>No school</li>
                <li>Your driving buddies are more likely to be free</li>

                <h3>Negatives of Summer</h3>
                <li>Most of the good spots to drive are crowded with other people at this time</li>
                <li>Can sometimes be too hot</li>

            <p>Since there aren't any RC tracks in the area, you have to get a little creative. But honestly, this just
                means that everywhere is a track. By far, my favourite spots to drive are construction sites while
                nobody is around. It's all loose dirt and with all the piles of dirt and rocks around, you have plenty
                of jumps at your disposal. The only down side to this is that you need a larger car to handle that kind
                of terrain and it's pretty easy to break your car if you're not careful.</p>

            <p>If you're having trouble finding constructions sites to dived, the next best location I can reccomend are
                public parks. One of the parks near my has a giant soccerfield and multiple baseball fields and there is
                almost always at least one field available at any given time. If you're dead set on constructions sites,
                try going to levelset.com and searching near your location to find potential driving sites.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>If you're interested in this hobby, it's really easy to get into. The only drawback is that it's quite
                expensive. Any of the good cars will run you hundreds of dollars. My favourite place to browse is Hobby
                Town USA which has plenty of great cars in store. Once you get your first car, all you have to do is
                charge it up and start ripping! If it breaks, since these are expenive hobby grade cars, all parts are
                availble to cheap at your local hobby store or online. All you need are come allen keys. </p>
            <p>If you're looking for a great relatively affordable RC cars, you can always ask around at your local
                hobby shop for reccomendations. If you ask me personally, I highly reccomend going 4 wheel drive. It's a
                little harder to work on but it's a much better driving experience. Two cars I can reccomend to start
                out with are the 4x4 brushed traxxas slash or the 4wd brushed traxxas rustler. Entry price there is
                around $300 but those cars handle good, take an absolute beating, and have plenty or parts available
                everywhere. </p>

            </figure>
            <p>I first got into the hobby thanks to my dad who grew up building and driving RC cars. I've seen and
                messsed with plenty of RC cars in my days. I even own a gas powered one. But I really love this hobby
                because it's a great way for me to get outdoors and have some fun. I also get to do some really crazy
                things with my cars, and since I'm not sitting in the driver seat, I'm perfectly safe. It's also a lot
                more affordable than real cars. </p>
            <p>I mainly reccomend this hobby to those who have someone to drive with, be that family or friend. There is
                also a huge community online and plenty of facebook groups for you to join and learn more about the
                hobby. It's really wholesome and everyone involved is really kind and willing tell you more about the
                hobby and their cars. That and the fact that you can really personalize your car to be your own and
                unique is why I got into thos hobby and have such a great time. This hobby gets you outdoors and
                spending time with others and gives you something to wrench on when you get home from an RC trip.</p>

            <h2>AI Prompts</h2>
            <p>Not a single one of the images used here are AI generated and all but one were taken by me.</p>
            <p>As for AI prompts, I did attempt to ask chat GPT for guidence on how to set up my javascript, but it did
                such a poor job that I really didn't use anything from it other than its reccomended method</p>
            <p>Prompt: "So this site is about my hobby which is RC cars. I want to have dedicated pages for each of the
                existing sections. BUT I don't want to create multiple .html files to do this. Everything has to be on
                the same html document. Essentially, I want to have a navbar that allows you to click and view each
                individual page while all other pages hare hidden. how would I go about doing that?"</p>
            <p>It reccomended to use javascript to hide all other sections and show only the one selected which I think
                is a good way to go about this. But The way it coded its example was not very good and in the html part
                for each section, it just started spamming divs everywhere. Since the task was pretty easy, I didn't
                bother using anything that GPT had to offer other than similar logic for my java script. Although, it's
                so simple that there really arent many other unique ways to do it that I could think of.</p>
