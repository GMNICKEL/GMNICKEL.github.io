        <ol>
            <li>Homepage - Project correctly starts with index.html inside of the projects folder.</li>
            <li>Spaces / upper-cases in file / folder names - No spaces or upper-case in file names.</li>
            <li>Design
                <ul>
                <li>Contrast / sizing - Text contrasts well against background and is perfectly readable at its current size.</li>
                <li>Color and font using CSS - Project correctly uses .css file to decorate.</li>
                <li>CRAP:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contrast - There is good contract and no strain on the eye.</li>
                        <li>Repetition - Different pages use the same theme and feel like they a part of the same site.</li>
                        <li>Alignment - All pages follow a grid like structure and are centered in the viewport.</li>
                        <li>Proximity - Images, text, and links are all properly spaced away from eachother. Text is easy to read and content is easy to digest.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul></li>

            <li>Page Has:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Header - All pages include a header element within the body.</header></li>
                    <li>Main - All pages include a main element within the body.</li>
                    <li>Footer - All pages include a footer element within the body.</li>
                    <li>Nav - All pages include working nav bar with adequate spacing between links. Only complaint is that the "Benitez Woodworking" title is link and it doesn't look ckickable. It also serves as the only way back to the index page for this project as far as I am aware. Because of that, it should be more oviously clickable. The nav bar does look beautiful though.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <li>Header with site / brand and h1 - All pages have a h1 element with the site / brand name.</li>
                <li>Main with h2 - Main includes h2 element and not h1 for all pages. H2 element uncludes page name.</li>
                <li>Footer with user pages - All pages include footer with correct links.</li>
                <li>Specific requirements:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Page includes fully functional html and css.</li>
                        <li>Page meets the minimum of 5 pages.</li>
                        <li>CSS file has only what is used.</li>
                        <li>All pages have a working nav bar.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Reccomendations:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The gallery, contact, and about pages are extremely bare bones. Maybe add some more content to those pages.</li>
                        <li>The dressers and chairs currently don't have their own pages like bedrfames does on the home page. Maybe change that at a later date.</li>
                    </ul>
