        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <p> Welcome to my Website Evaluations Page! Here you will see what a website should and should not look like.
        </p>

            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Homepage</a>
            <p>Microsoft's homepage. This webpage allows you to browse products, seek customer service, access different microsoft software, and plenty more.</p>
            <p>CRAP Principles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast - there is heavy use of black text on a white background which usually isn't recommended but it offers great contrast and is easy to read.</li>
                <li>Repetition - The website is very conform and stays true to its style. Even after clicking through different links, the website theme doesn't change much.</li>
                <li>Alignment - The main page is very blocky and even. Everything is centered and ordered in a grid like fashion. Even the advertisements follow the alignment of the page.</li>
                <li>Proximity - Everything is grouped together with whatever they are related with. For example, all gaming related things are together. Bold is used sparingly so that only headers and other important information sticks out. Of course, the headers and such are in close proximity to whatever content they refer to.</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a>
            <p>The home webpage of the Yale School of Art. This webpage serves as a hub for students to be informed on important dates as well as access many different resources from their school.</p>
            <p>CRAP Principles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast - Most of the text is a noticeably different color from the background and is therefore easy to read. However on some occasions, due to the background, the text can be hard to read. The best example of this would be address at the top of the webpage.</li>
                <li>Repetition - The only repeating thing on this page is that the font color is black about 90 percent of the time. Other than that, background colors for text appear to have been picked at random and the font size changes regularly.</li>
                <li>Alignment - Most elements on this page are not aligned properly. In fact, the content is not even centered on the page and there is a huge portion of unused space on the right hand side of the screen. There is some organization in terms of certain content being grouped together but overall the webpage is very chaotic.</li>
                <li>Proximity - Due to the text sizes varying so heavily and abuse of bold font, making important information stick out is much harder to do. Related information is generally in close proximity.</li>
            </ul>
