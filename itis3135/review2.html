        <ol>
            <li>Homepage - Project correctly starts with index.html inside of the projects folder.</li>
            <li>Spaces / upper-cases in file / folder names - No spaces or upper-case in file names.</li>
            <li>Design
                <ul>
                <li>Contrast / sizing - Text appears to contrasts decently well against background. However, the h1 at the top and the links in the footer may not contrast enough. I am able to read them but I can't tell if accumulus would bring this up or not because accumulus is not present.</li>
                <li>Color and font using CSS - Project correctly uses .css file to decorate.</li>
                <li>CRAP:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contrast - There is contrast but as mentioned earlier, maybe more contrast for the h1 and links in the footer is needed.</li>
                        <li>Repetition - Different pages use the same theme and feel like they a part of the same site.</li>
                        <li>Alignment - All pages follow a grid like structure and are centered in the viewport except for the home page. This may only be happening because of the images not loading correctly. </li>
                        <li>Proximity - Images, text, and links are all properly spaced away from eachother. Text is easy to read and content is easy to digest.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul></li>

            <li>Page Has:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Header - All pages include a header element within the body.</li>
                    <li>Main - All pages include a main element within the body.</li>
                    <li>Footer - All pages include a footer element within the body.</li>
                    <li>Nav - All pages include working nav bar with adequate spacing between links.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <li>Header with site / brand and h1 - All pages have a h1 element with the site / brand name.</li>
                <li>Main with h2 - Main includes h2 element and not h1 for all pages. H2 element uncludes page name.</li>
                <li>Footer with user pages - All pages include footer with correct links except for "Brandon A. Designs" which currently has a broken link.</li>
                <li>Specific requirements:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Page includes functional html, css, and js. Some of the images fail to load however.</li>
                        <li>Page meets the minimum of 5 pages.</li>
                        <li>CSS file has only what is used.</li>
                        <li>All pages have a working nav bar.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Reccomendations:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most of the photos fail to load. At least on my end. Further troubleshooting may be required on your end.</li>
                        <li>The commisions and contact forms are very similar and having both may be redundant.</li>
                        <li>Accumulus does not appear to be present on any of the project pages.</li>
                        <li>The link to your project overview page works but fails to load the css onced clicked on.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <li>Noteworthy mentions - The animations on the portfolio page are very cool!</li>
