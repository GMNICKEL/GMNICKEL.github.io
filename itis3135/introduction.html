        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I was born in Harrisburg, NC, then later moved to Huntersville.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> Worked at Grease Monkey for 2 years. I also had an internship
                with
                ATD Computers, Huntersville, working on computers over one of my summer breaks.</li>
            <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I’m a junior at UNCC currently majoring in Computer Science with a
                concentration in IT.</li>
            <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> I’ve taken all prerequisite classes. I have very little
                experience with website development.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> HP Windows 11 laptop and Windows 10 desktop.
            </li>
            <p class="center"><strong>Courses I’m Taking &amp; Why:</strong></p>
            <ul class="indent-right">
                <li><strong>ITIS 3135 - Web App Design &amp; Development:</strong> Required class for my
                    major.
                    I’m also really interested in learning how to make a website.
                </li>
                <li><strong>ITIS 3200 - Intro to Info &amp; Priv:</strong> Required for my concentration. I’m
                    also
                    interested in learning how cyber attacks work and how to defend against them.</li>
                <li><strong>ITIS 4350 - Design Prototyping:</strong> I took the prerequisite class for this by
                    the
                    same instructor where we also did design prototyping and I had fun.</li>
                <li><strong>ANTH 1501 - Global Social Science:</strong> Required to take courses unrelated to
                    my
                    major. I’m not exactly thrilled for this class.
                </li>
